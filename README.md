Important Notice- The tableau file attached is .twbx file so one can download and view and analyze without any datasource

Project Overview

This project is focused on analyzing COVID-19 data, including infection rates, death statistics, and regional impacts. The data is structured into SQL tables for easy querying and insights.

Data Source

The SQL file included in this project (covid_19.sql) comes from our previous COVID-19 analysis. It contains preprocessed data and queries related to:

Global and regional infection counts

Death percentages and total cases

Population infection percentages

Temporal trends in COVID-19 spread

SQL Tables

The database consists of four primary tables:

Death Statistics – Contains total cases, total deaths, and calculated death percentages.

Continental Death Counts – Summarizes COVID-19 deaths by continent.

Location-Based Infection Data – Lists the highest infection counts, percentage of the population infected, and total population.

Temporal Data – Tracks infection counts over time across different locations.

Dashboards

This analysis is visualized across four key dashboards:

Global Overview – Displays total cases, total deaths, and death percentage worldwide.

Continental Impact – Shows total deaths across different continents.

Infection Spread – Analyzes the percentage of the population infected globally.

Forecasting Trends – Provides predictive insights for major countries.

How to Use
